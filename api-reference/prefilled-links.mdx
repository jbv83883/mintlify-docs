## Storefront

You can share links of your products that are either unlisted or present on your website, but at the same time, prefill certain fields that might be known or simply useless, and thus skipped.

The prefilled fields are present in the querystring, such as `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/product/<PRODUCT_SLUG>?quantity=5&gateway=LITECOIN&step=1`

<Info>`YOUR_DOMAIN` is either your Sellix store name (`YourStoreName.mysellix.io`) and `PRODUCT_SLUG` is either the uniqid of the product you want to share or its slug (taken from the title).</Info>

### Available querystring parameters

Here is a list of all available querystring parameters, along with a brief description of each

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `quantity` | Specifies the number of the same product to purchase |
| `gateway` | Specifies which payment gateway should be selected ([see full list of available gateways](/api-reference/payment-methods)) |
| `step` | Specifies which step of the checkout process should be displayed. `enum(0,1,3)` |
| `email` | The customer's email address |
| `couponCode` | The code of a coupon that should be applied automatically to the purchase |

**Step**

The available step number to be configured on links is one of
- `0`, the default checkout step (product details)
- `1`, the gateway choice step
- `3`, the email and pay button step

## Payment Links

The same logic applies to [payment links](https://dashboard.sellix.io/links); however, they natively support the `Generate Prefilled Link+` button, which helps you create a pre-filled querystring sharable link that you can send to your customers.
