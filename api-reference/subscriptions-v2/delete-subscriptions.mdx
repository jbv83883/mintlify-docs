title: "Cancel Subscription"
openapi: delete /subscriptions_v2/{uniqid}

<Note>
The `uniqid` path parameter is the `.uniqid` field for the **subscription** object. It should start with `sub_`
</Note>
<Warning>
This endpoint does not immediately cancel the subscription. Instead, it changes the status to `AWAIT_CANCELING`, and sets it to stop renewing once the current payment interval ends.
