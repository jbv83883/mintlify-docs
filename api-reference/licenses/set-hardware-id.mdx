Setting an hardware ID must be done through your software, Sellix does not do it automatically.
This enables you to lock one specific license key to a device, you will then be able to check for the hardware ID every time youâ€™re issuing a license check through our other API.

<Info>Through the hardware ID, you can lock one specific license to one device only.</Info>
