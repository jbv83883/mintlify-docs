# Where is the Sandbox?

Let's get to the point: Sellix does not have a sandbox environment.

<Info>
  We could go around and say that we don't believe in it, that we cannot due to operating with cryptos, this and that and whatever else, but the truth is that we've decided to focus on feature and product development instead.
</Info>

The best way to try out payments and every other feature is to create a secondary store (which you can do for free) and use it for development purposes.
Feel free to use any test data, you can also use the complete payment endpoint on invoices that have no gateway to test out the full flow of funds.

Should you need to clean up your store, delete it or anything else, feel free to [reach out to our support team](mailto:support@sellix.io) and we'll be happy to help.

# Will there ever be a Sandbox?

Yes! It's on our roadmap and we're actively working on it.
Unfortunately, we cannot give an ETA as of now.
