## Dispute Reason

Occasionally, something goes wrong with a customer's order. To dispute a charge, a customer can create a dispute with PayPal or ask his or her bank or credit card company to dispute and reverse a charge, which is known as a chargeback.

When a customer disputes a charge, we will notify you by email and Discord (if you have set up our Bot).
The dispute reason is why the customer has opened a dispute against your order.

| Dispute Reason | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `MERCHANDISE_OR_SERVICE_NOT_RECEIVED` | The customer did not receive the merchandise or service. |
| `MERCHANDISE_OR_SERVICE_NOT_AS_DESCRIBED` | The customer reports that the merchandise or service is not as described. |
| `UNAUTHORISED` | The customer did not authorize the purchase of the merchandise or service. |
| `CREDIT_NOT_PROCESSED` | The refund or credit was not processed for the customer. |
| `DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION` | The transaction was a duplicate. |
| `INCORRECT_AMOUNT` | The customer was charged an incorrect amount. |
| `PAYMENT_BY_OTHER_MEANS` | The customer paid for the transaction through other means. |
| `CANCELED_RECURRING_BILLING` | The customer was being charged for a subscription or a recurring transaction that was canceled. |
| `PROBLEM_WITH_REMITTANCE` | A problem occurred with the remittance. |

## Dispute Outcome

When a dispute is solved, its outcome is updated.

## Dispute Life Cycle Stage

The stage in the dispute lifecycle

| Dispute Reason | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `INQUIRY` | A customer and merchant interact in an attempt to resolve a dispute without escalation to PayPal. Occurs when the customer: Has not received goods or a service. Reports that the received goods or services are not as described. Needs more details, such as a copy of the transaction or a receipt. |
| `CHARGEBACK` | A customer or merchant escalates an inquiry to a claim, which authorizes PayPal to investigate the case and make a determination. Occurs only when the dispute channel is INTERNAL. This stage is a PayPal dispute lifecycle stage and not a credit card or debit card chargeback. All notes that the customer sends in this stage are visible to PayPal agents only. The customer must wait for PayPalâ€™s response before the customer can take further action. In this stage, PayPal shares dispute details with the merchant, who can complete one of these actions: accept the claim, submit evidence to challenge the claim, make an offer to the customer to resolve the claim. |
| `PRE_ARBITRATION` | The first appeal stage for merchants. A merchant can appeal a chargeback if PayPal's decision is not in the merchant's favor. If the merchant does not appeal within the appeal period, PayPal considers the case resolved. |
| `ARBITRATION` | The second appeal stage for merchants. A merchant can appeal a dispute for a second time if the first appeal was denied. If the merchant does not appeal within the appeal period, the case returns to a resolved status in a pre-arbitration stage. |

## Dispute Message Posted By

Indicates whether the customer, merchant, or dispute arbiter posted the message.

| Dispute Reason | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `BUYER` | The customer posted the message. |
| `SELLER` | The merchant posted the message. |
| `ARBITER` | The arbiter of the dispute posted the message. |
