# Why are there two versions?

[Subscriptions (legacy)](https://docs.sellix.io/api-reference/subscriptions) is the first ever subscription model released on the Sellix platform.
It provides basic, simple and fundamental recurring billing features such as accepting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly payments through PayPal, Stripe, Cryptocurrencies and other gateways.

[Subscriptions 2.0](https://docs.sellix.io/api-reference/subscriptions-2-0) on the other hand introduce advanced options for a broader range of business models and many features that are standard in modern subscription management platforms, from upgrades and downgrades to discounts, tiered plans and more.

<Info>
  We recommend all new subscriptions be created using Subscriptions 2.0 to always have the latest features available, however Subscriptions (legacy) will continue to work, be supported and receive bugfixes and security patches along the way.
