## Types

Errors will only ever be present within the `400` to `503` response status range.

<Warning>
  `4xx` errors will be inside the response JSON (`response.status`), whilst `5xx` errors are sent as an HTTP status code.

  With the exception of rate-limiting errors (`429`), which are served by Cloudflare, and have both a `response.status` JSON and the HTTP `429` status code.
</Warning>

All errors will include a `response.error` attribute detailing the error message.

The Sellix API uses the following error codes:

| Code | Description                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters. |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Unable to authenticate. |
| `403` | Forbidden - The request is not allowed. |
| `404` | Not Found - The specified resource could not be found. |
| `406` | Not Acceptable - You requested a format that isn't json. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - You have reached the rate limit. |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - We had a problem with our server. Try again later. These are rare. |
| `503` | Service Unavailable - We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later. |

## Rate-limits

Rate-limiting errors (`429`) happen when you are sending too many requests to the developers API.

### How it works

Our rate-limiting system is based on 10-second intervals rather than 1, meaning that you can make a burst of API calls within the first second, then wait 9 seconds and do it again.

<Info>For example, if you are on the `Standard` tier with 50 req/10s, you can send 50 requests within a second, then wait 9 seconds to send the others and it would work.</Info>

If you go over the allowed rate-limit for your tier, we <Tooltip tip="The WAF will block any requests exceeding the configured rate, and the remaining requests will be allowed. For example, if you send 60 requests in 10 seconds when you're only allowed to send 50, 10 will be blocked. You will not be rate-limited for X minutes after this, you will be able to immediately send other requests.">throttle your requests over the maximum configured rate for that tier</Tooltip>.

### General endpoints

All Sellix API endpoints are rate-limited. Based on your tier, you have access to different rate-limiting values.

<Note>To upgrade to a higher tier, please reach out to us at sales@sellix.io or through our [Discord community](https://sellix.io/discord)</Note>

| Tier | Limits |
| ---- | ------ |
| `Standard` | 50 req/10s |
| `Tier 1` | 75 req/10s |
| `Tier 2` | 100 req/10s |
| `Tier 3` | 500 req/10s |

### Payment endpoints

If you are on the standard version, payment endpoints are highly restricted compared to the general endpoints.

<Note>To upgrade to a higher tier, please reach out to us at sales@sellix.io or through our [Discord community](https://sellix.io/discord)</Note>

| Tier | Limits |
| ---- | ------ |
| `Standard` | 10 req/10s |
| `Tier 1` | 75 req/10s |
| `Tier 2` | 100 req/10s |
| `Tier 3` | 500 req/10s |

## Pending orders

<Warning>There is a limit on how many pending orders you can have, both for your store and for single customers.</Warning>

A pending order is an order that has been created but has not been paid yet.

Orders with a payment method chosen are voided within 24 hours and orders without a payment method chosen are voided within 14 days.

These limits are increased based on how many successful orders you have in the past and a few other factors that are not publicly disclosed.

Improving the trustworthiness of your store will help you get a higher limit.

PO = pending orders

| Tier       | PO   | PO per customer |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------- |
| `Standard` | 100  | 10              |
| `Tier 1`   | 200  | 10              |
| `Tier 2`   | 500  | 10              |
| `Tier 3`   | 1000 | 10              |
| `Custom`   | any  | any             |

<Info>
  If you're planning to launch on Sellix with a high number of initial clients and are unsure as to how many pending orders you're expecting, please reach out to us at sales@sellix.io or through our [Discord community](https://sellix.io/discord).
