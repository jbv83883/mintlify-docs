## Checkout Flow

We currently support two types of checkout flows for Sellix Payments: Integrated and White-label.
You can also pass a `product_id` or multiple `product_ids` through a cart object.

<Card title="Create a Payment" icon="money-simple-from-bracket" href="/api-reference/payments/post-payments">
  Create a payment to collect revenue from your customers, pass any amount, gateway, and configuration.
</Card>
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Complete a Payment" icon="check-to-slot" href="/api-reference/payments/post-payments">
    Flag a payment as completed to process the order
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete a Payment" icon="xmark" href="/api-reference/payments/delete-payments">
    Cancel a payment to void it from receiving any transaction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get Order" icon="dice-one" href="/api-reference/orders/get-order">
    Get the details of one of your payments (referenced as `order` in the API)
  </Card>
  <Card title="List Orders" icon="bars-staggered" href="/api-reference/orders/list-orders">
    List all the orders created on your store with pagination
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Integrated

With the integrated checkout option, Sellix handles the checkout aspect for you by only returning a unique payment URL. This unique URL contains our realtime checkout page.

### White-label

The white-label checkout flow provides the raw order created rather than a payment URL. With the raw order information, you are able to develop and integrate your own checkout experience completely separate from Sellix.

<Info>To receive real-time status updates about the order, consider using our [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks)</Info>

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "unqid": "sample-uniqid",
    "total_display": 10,
    "currency": "USD",
    "crypto_address": "btc1sample...",
    "crypto_amount": 1.28572,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Products
We offer the possibility to create payments for your products too. You can specify a `product_id`, and we will take care of the rest.
