## Webhook Events for Subscription Lifecycle
Subscriptions 2.0 offers comprehensive webhook events to keep track of each stage in a subscription's lifecycle. Configure webhooks in your Sellix dashboard to receive notifications for various events.

### Journey
<Steps>
  <Step title="Trial Started">
    Event: `subscription-v2:trial-interval:started`
    *Only sent if a trial period is configured for this subscription product*

    The trial period for a subscription has started. No invoice has been created yet.
    If this webhook is sent, it is preceded by a `subscription-v2:trial-interval:created` event with a unique status.

    <Tip>
      The subscription status will be `ACTIVE` during the trial period, but the current interval during the trial will have a `payment_type` of `TRIAL`
    </Tip>

    <Note>Please note that if the product has a trial period, the trial period cannot be circumvented.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trial Canceled">
    Event: `subscription-v2:trial-interval:canceled`
    *Only sent if a trial period is configured for this subscription product*

    The trial period for a subscription has been canceled. One of the following events will be sent alongside this one:
    - `subscription-v2:trial-interval:canceled-merchant`: When the subscription is canceled by the merchant through their Sellix dashboard.
    - `subscription-v2:trial-interval:canceled-customer`: When the subscription is canceled by the customer through an embeddable or the Customer Billing Portal.
    - `subscription-v2:trial-interval:canceled-api`: When the subscription is canceled by calling the `DELETE /subscriptions_v2/{uniqid}` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trial Ended">
    Event: `subscription-v2:trial-interval:ended`
    *Only sent if a trial period is configured for this subscription product*

    The trial period for a subscription has ended.
    Immediately after this event is triggered, the `subscription-v2:payment-interval:started` and `subscription-v2:payment-interval:created` events will be sent indicating that the first payment interval has been requested. **This does not mean that the payment was received**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Started">
    Event: `subscription-v2:started`

    This event is triggered when the status of the subscription goes from `PENDING` to `ACTIVE`, meaing once your customer's subscription has been started and the payment has succeeded. You can use this event to implement any logic that should be executed once the subscription is purchased.
    
    We **highly suggest the usage of our custom fields to act as a metadata object** in order to recognize which customer purchased your subscription and activate it for them.

    This webhook event is typically preceeded by the `subscription-v2:created` event, which is sent when the subscription is created with a status of `PENDING`.

    When a subscription first starts, the following events will be triggered alongside this one, each with their respective `created` event:
    - `subscription-v2:plan:started`: Triggered every time a payment plan for a subscription is started.
    - `subscription-v2:payment-interval:started`: Treated every time a payment interval for a subscription is started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Gateway Changes">
    Event: `subscription-v2:plan:gateway-changed`
    
    Changing the gateway for a subscription will not create a new subscription. The recurring invoice will be charged through the new gateway.
    If the customer updates his preferred gateway for the subscription through our API via the `PUT /subscriptions_v2/{uniqid}` endpoint, embeddables or the Customer Billing Portal, you will receive a webhook event with the updated subscription object.

    This event can be triggered alongside the `subscription-v2:plan:payment-method-changed` event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Updates">
    Events: `subscription-v2:plan:upgrade` or `subscription-v2:plan:downgrade`

    When the customer or merchant changes the plan of their subscription via the `POST /subscriptions_v2` endpoint, embeddables, the Customer Billing Portal, or the merchant dashboard, one of these events will be triggered. 
    When a subscription plan changes, the following events will be triggered alongside this one:
    - `subscription-v2:plan:started`: Triggered alongside `subscription-v2:plan:created` every time a new plan is selected for the subscription
    - `subscription-v2:ended`: Upgrades and downgrades will complete the subscription plan, which sends this event.
    - `subscription-v2:plan:ended`: Triggers whenever the subscription plan changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Canceled">
    Events: `subscription-v2:canceled` and `subscription-v2:plan:canceled` and `subscription-v2:plan:payment-canceled`
    
    Subscription cancelation by either the customer or the merchant triggers this event. The status of the subscription will be `CANCELED` or `AWAIT_CANCELING`.
    One of the following events will be sent alongside this one:
    - `subscription-v2:canceled-merchant`: When the subscription is canceled by the merchant through their Sellix dashboard. The `subscription-v2:plan:canceled-merchant` event is also sent.
    - `subscription-v2:canceled-customer`: When the subscription is canceled by the customer through an embeddable or the Customer Billing Portal. The `subscription-v2:plan:canceled-customer` event is also sent.
    - `subscription-v2:canceled-api`: When the subscription is canceled by calling the `DELETE /subscriptions_v2/{uniqid}` endpoint. The `subscription-v2:plan:canceled-api` event is also sent.
    
    The following events are also sent: `subscription-v2:payment-interval:canceled`, `subscription-v2:payment-interval:canceled-merchant`, `subscription-v2:payment-interval:canceled-customer`, `subscription-v2:payment-interval:canceled-api` and `subscription-v2:payment-interval:payment-canceled`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upcoming Payment">
    Event `subscription-v2:payment-interval:upcoming`

  The event is sent a week before the current payment interval's end. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Renewal">
    Event `subscription-v2:ended`

    The first part of the renewal process is ending the previous `plan` and `payment_interval`. These events will be triggered as part of that process:
    - `subscription-v2:plan:ended`: When the subscription's plan has reached the end of its current interval.
    - `subscription-v2:payment-interval:ended`: When the subscription's payment interval has ended.

    The second part is creating a new `payment_` and `plan_` for the subscription. These events will be triggered as part of that process:
    - `subscription-v2:plan:payment-succeeded`: When the payment for the subscription plan has been successfully processed.
    - `subscription-v2:payment-interval:payment-succeeded`: When the payment interval for the subscription has been successfully processed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscription Failed">
    Event: `subscription-v2:plan:payment-failed`

    The payment for the subscription has failed. The subscription will remain `ACTIVE` and the payment will be retried at a later time. When the payment is retried, the `subscription-v2:payment-interval:charge-retried` event will be triggered, and if the retry does not succeed, the `subscription-v2:payment-interval:charge-failed` and `subscription-v2:payment-interval:payment-failed` events may be sent
    If the payment is not updated, the subscription will be canceled and the `subscription-v2:canceled` event will be triggered. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tip>

## Advanced Subscription Features
Here's a brief list of other cool features, for a full overview see the [full list here](#full-list).

### Billing Options
Subscriptions 2.0 supports a new and improved billing system with advanced customization options. Each subscription plan can have separate billing settings.
- **Payment Type:** Choose whether customers are charged in `ADVANCE` (at the start of the billing cycle), or `ARREARS` (at the end of the billing cycle; good for usage based subscriptions).
- **Renew Type:** Choose whether the subscription is renewed on the first of every month (`CALENDAR`), or on the anniversary of the subscription start date (`ANNIVERSARY`).
- **Billing Type:** Choose whether customers pay the full amount of the subscription when they first subscribe (`FULL`), or if the subscription is `PROTATED` to dynamically charge the customer based on the remaining time in the billing cycle.
- **Custom Intervals:** Subscriptions 2.0 provides four base intervals: `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, and `YEARLY`, which can be paired with integer values to customize the interval length when creating the subscription product. This implementation has no restrictions on payment method and is handled by Sellix
- **Upgrades/Downgrades:** Subscriptions 2.0 supports **upgrades and downgrades between subscription plans with no overhead**. Everything is handled internally, and webhook events (`subscription-v2:plan:upgrade`) and (`subscription-v2:plan:downgrade`) are automatically emitted so you can handle your server logic accordingly

Customers can change their gateway, payment method, payment plan, and more without creating a new subscription. All changes will automatically take effect, and the price change will automatically take effect as set by the merchant. 

Subscriptions 2.0 support the customer balance, allowing customers to use funds in their customer portal to pay for subscription fees

### Subscription Addons
Specify any additional payment that can be added for a single month or for a longer period of time, giving your customers a way to add optional benefits or perks to your subscriptions.

<Info>
  Addons have an optional field called **All Recurring Bill Invoices** similarly to coupons. if it is checked, then the addon will be applied to all invoices created for the subscription, otherwise only for the first invoice.
</Info>

<Frame>

    className="block"
    src="/images/subs_v2_addons.png"
    alt="Customer Billing Portal"
  />
</Frame>

### Upgrades/Downgrades
Upgrades and Downgrades can happen when a customer changes their subscription plan, when a merchant changes a customer's subscription plan, or when a customer resubscribes to an existing subscription with a different plan. Both upgrades and downgrades will change the renewal date of a subscription.
- `DOWNGRADE`: The current plan will remain `ACTIVE`. A new plan will be created with the `PENDING` status and will not be `ACTIVE` until the current plan has ended.
- `UPGRADE`: The current plan will be `COMPLETED`, and any unused time will be credited to the customer's balance. The new plan will be activated immediately after the payment is received.
<Info>
  To upgrade a subscription via our API, you can use the `POST /subscriptions_v2` endpoint with the same `email` to overwrite the existing subscription. The subscription will be upgraded/downgraded based on the new plan's price.
</Info>

## Customer Billing Portal
Every customer will have access to their customer billing portal, where they can view, cancel, and update any active subscription purchased from you or any other business on our platform.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block"
    src="https://sellix.io/cdn-cgi/image/q=65/https://cdn.sellix.io/static/documentation/images/customer-portal.png"
    alt="Customer Billing Portal"
  />
</Frame>


They will authenticate using their personal email address, used to purchase your product subscription. The customer billing portal can be found at `YOUR_DOMAIN/customer/auth`

## Integrations
Three ways to integrate subscriptions into your website.

<Card title="Sellix Hosted Experience" icon="browser" href="https://dashboard.sellix.io/products">
  You will be using our hosted experience through `YOUR_DOMAIN`, asking customers for their ID/Email/Username through product custom fields to activate the subscription on their account.
</Card>

<Card title="Customized embeds" icon="frame" href="https://dashboard.sellix.io/developer/embed">
  Through product embeds.
  You can embed subscription products on your website, and automatically set hidden custom fields to uniquely identify your customers when the webhook events are sent.
</Card>

<Card title="Developers API" icon="code" href="/api-reference/subscriptions-2-0/post-subscriptions">
  Brandless implementation with our API.
  Use your own logo and website to manage customers and subscriptions.
  Currently, the documentation is hosted on dev-openapi.sellix.io. However, it will soon be available on this page as well, with an improved document.
</Card>

## Cryptocurrencies
From the get-go, we support subscriptions billed automatically through cryptocurrencies.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block"
    src="https://sellix.io/cdn-cgi/image/q=65/https://cdn.sellix.io/static/documentation/images/crypto-subscriptions.png"

  />
</Frame>

This works by approving X recurring payments on the customer's cryptocurrency wallet and automatically sending a transaction for each renewal period.
