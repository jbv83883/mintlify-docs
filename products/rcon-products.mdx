## Sell content directly to your server users
We're excited to announce one of the biggest updates we're releasing this month: support for RCON gaming and server connections.

Merchants can now directly sell content for their gaming communities (**Ark, GTA V, Minecraft and more**) through Sellix by connecting their servers and configuring products to deliver any asset to any player.

If you have a large gaming community and need custom specifications, features, and/or updates, email sales@sellix.io, and we'll get to it ASAP.
