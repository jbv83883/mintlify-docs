## Customer Portal

Customers are also able to manage their purchased licenses through the customer portal.

<Info>The customer portal can be accessed through the merchant domain `MERCHANT_DOMAIN/customer/auth`, `MERCHANT_DOMAIN` is composed with either a custom domain (if connected), or the store name (`YOUR_STORE_NAME.mysellix.io`).</Info>
