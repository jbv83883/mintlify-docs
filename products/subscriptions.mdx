They will also be able to change the active payment method, add new ones and view their transaction history.

## No-Code implementations

Certain subscription integrations do not require businesses to write a single line of code. Let's learn how!

### For communities

If you wish to monetize your Discord or Telegram communities, we have tools for it. By integrating with our Subscription system, you can do that with zero lines of code.

By connecting your Discord or Telegram community to our system, with or without coding, you are able to

- Automatically add a customer to your Discord Server/Telegram Group
- Automatically add a role to the customer's Discord user
- Automatically remove the customer from your Discord Server/Telegram Group if they stop paying
- Automatically remove the customer from your Discord Server/Telegram Group if 
the subscription period ends

### For serials

When creating a subscription, you are able to choose a Subtype (`File`, `Serials`, `Service`, `Dynamic`).

<Info>Learn more about Dynamic products [here](/api-reference/dynamic-products)</Info>

By using dynamic products, you can create recurring payments that send your customer a new kind of product every time that a payment succeeds.

For example, if your product subtype is Serials, we will automatically send your customer a new serial for the configured product.
