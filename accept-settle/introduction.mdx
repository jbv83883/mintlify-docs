## For Individuals, Businesses and Institutions

Through Accept->Settle, Sellix merchants have access to the full featureset and products that we have to offer with an additional configuration for the final part of the payment flow: settlements.

Merchants can configure any settlement option they want, for example Bitcoin into EUR, ETH into USDC, XRP into BTC and everything else into USDT.

<Tip>
  When settlements into FIAT is configured, Sellix ensures merchants to receive the exact FIAT amount they have billed their customers even when accepting cryptocurrencies. **For any amount, any blockchain, any asset**.

  When using the Accept->Settle configuration, merchants are able to accept cryptocurrency and fiat payments through Sellix and settle into the currency of their choice.

  This effectively removes the need to worry for market volatility and the hassle of declaring cryptocurrency income and earnings.
