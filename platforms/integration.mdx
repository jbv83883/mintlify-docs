Once you've been approved for the program, you can start using the API to create sub-accounts and process payments on their behalf.

## Integration types

Depending on the Custodial or Non-custodial integration type, you will have two different integration flows.

<Warning>
  The custodial and non-custodial integration are currently on a closed invite-only program.

  If you're interested in joining the program, please [contact our team](mailto:sales@sellix.io).
</Warning>

### Custodial

The custodial integration relies entirely on Sellix APIs, it is easier to implement and ensures better configuration control.

<Info>
  See the differences between the custodial and non-custodial integration in the [comparison](/platforms/introduction#custodial-or-non-custodial) section.

### Non-Custodial

The non-custodial integration requires a more complex setup, due to the need of offering a fully non-custodial setup, configuration and experience to your sub-accounts.
