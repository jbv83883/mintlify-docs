title: 'Create sub-account payment'
openapi: post /payments?sub-account=true
---

<Info>
  The API payload for creating a payment on behalf of a sub-account works exactly like the standard merchant one.

  The only difference is that you need to specify the `platform_on_behalf_of` field with the sub-account ID.
</Info>

<Warning>
  The `sub-account` query parameter is not required and will not change the response.
