## What's the Custody Dashboard?

Each sub-account has access to custom features through their custody dashboard, which are sub-account specific and come for free with the custodial integration.

## Custom settlements

Besides configuring standard details, sub-accounts can also decide to automatically settle cryptocurrency payments into fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

By doing so they can avoid the market volatility and the hassle of declaring cryptocurrency income and earnings, leaving all of that to Sellix.

## Whitelabeling

The platform can whitelabel the custody dashboard, giving it a look and feel that matches the platform's branding.
