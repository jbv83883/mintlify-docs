## Sub-accounts

You should create a sub-account for each person or business using your platform (your merchants). Sub-accounts should not be used for customers of your customers.

You are then able to create payments on behalf of the sub-account, manage the funds in their wallet and do any custom operation you want.

## Compliance

In the Sellix Custodial version, each sub-account needs to pass Sellix's compliance process, which includes either KYC or KYB and AML checks pursuant to the regulations of the country of the sub-account.

Sellix handles the compliance process automatically at no additional expense to you, the process is required before payments can be created on behalf of the sub-account.

The compliance process is done through the custody dashboard, you can get the link to redirect the sub-account to by calling the endpoint.
